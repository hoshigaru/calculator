Project: Calculator (as part of the Odin Project)

Okay, that was fun to figure out! My calculator could do with some QOL updates and has a few strange bugs left, but I'll leave it for now. The hardest part was figuring out how to do the actual calculations, and I mostly got that down! I'm excited to keep going and learn more.
